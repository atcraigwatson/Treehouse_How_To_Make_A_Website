## Treehouse How To Make A Website Course ( *with a little extra* )

This is a repository containing the files created when following along with the **How to Make a Website** course on treehouse.

Please feel free to requests any changes to this repository that may help!

I have used the gh-pages branch for this repository to host a working version of the site, the link below will get you there.

[How to Make a Website](http://atcraigwatson.github.io/Treehouse_How_To_Make_A_Website/)

There is an extra page on this site that explains the HTML used and what it is used for as well as some information in the CSS used.

For ease of reading the code used to create the pages related to the course I will be creating a page using the *pre* tag to stop you needing to dive in to the inspector to see the code.

As mentioned above this is for helping people so please feel free to make recommendations or contact me directly for help!
