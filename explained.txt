<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. -->


<html></html>
<!-- The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document. The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag). -->


<head></head> 
<!-- The <head> element is a container for all the head elements. The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.

<meta>  
<!-- Metadata is data (information) about data. The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable. Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata. The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services. -->


<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. This tells the browser how the web page is formated and what type of character are used. -->


<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<!-- A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links to see the difference. -->


<title></title>

<section></section>
<!-- The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. -->


<footer></footer>   
<!-- The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section. A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element. A <footer> element typically contains: authorship information, copyright information, contact information, sitemap, back to top links and related documents. You can have several <footer> elements in one document. -->

<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>

<h6></h6>
<!-- The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading. -->


<p></p>
<!-- The <p> tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each <p> element. The margins can be modified with CSS (with the margin properties). -->


<a></a>
<!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue, a visited link is underlined and purple and an active link is underlined and red. -->

<!-- The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the <a> tag is not a hyperlink. -->


<nav></nav>
<!-- The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links. Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links. Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content. -->


<ul></ul>

<img>
<!-- The <img> tag defines an image in an HTML page. The <img> tag has two required attributes: src and alt. Note: Images are not technically inserted into an HTML page, images are linked to HTML pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image. Tip: To link an image to another document, simply nest the <img> tag inside <a> tags. -->


<img src="">
<!-- The required src attribute specifies the URL of the image. Possible values: An absolute URL - points to another web site (like src="http://www.example.com/image.gif"). A relative URL - points to a file within a web site (like src="image.gif"). -->


<img alt="">
<!-- The required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed. The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). -->
